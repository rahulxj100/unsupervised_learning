# PCA - Implementation

1.In this notebook, I have trained two SVM models to classifiy vehicle categories, the first model used all the available independent paramters and the second model, uses PCA for dimentionality to classify the same. I have tried to show that even with reduced number of paramters, we can achieve similar, levels of performance.
2.EDA was also performed
